 Coral - Snake game challenge
 ==============================

 Coral is intended as a programming exercise.

 It consists of a very simple version of the classic 80s arcade snake game
 written in Python, provided as an initial codebase that the learner should
 further extend. It was originally created as an educational resource to teach
 open-source development practices, tools, and project management methodologies
 to graduate computer science students. 

 The exercise consists of:

 a) Fixing the listed known issues (bugs and requested features).

 b) Improving the game by adding some exciting new features.
